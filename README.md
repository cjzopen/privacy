# Privacy Policy
URL Parameter Eraser does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information or browsing history. All settings and data are stored locally on the user's device.

## Information Collection and Use
This extension does not collect any data.
As a result, we do not use, share, or transmit any user information to third parties.

## Functionality
URL Parameter Eraser removes tracking parameters from the current page URL and rewrites links containing such parameters on the page. These modified links are visually marked with a purple dashed outline.

Users can customize which parameters to remove or ignore through the settings panel. All preferences are stored locally using Chrome Extension Storage. The developer has no access to this data.

## Data Security
Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data exposure or leakage. The extension operates entirely on the client side.

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU)
* California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (California, USA)
* Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) (China)
